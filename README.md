# CLASIC CALCULATOR v1.0

## APP SUMMARY

This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code represents a simple yet interactive calculator web application. The HTML structure defines the layout, including a display area, a simulated solar panel, and various buttons for numbers, operators, and special functions. The CSS applies styles to ensure a modern and visually appealing design, including custom fonts, a responsive layout, and 3D button effects. The JavaScript handles the calculator's functionality, including number input, arithmetic operations, and a countdown timer that powers off the display after a period of inactivity. Special features include converting numbers to words, playing audio effects, and rotating the calculator display when specific numbers are entered.
