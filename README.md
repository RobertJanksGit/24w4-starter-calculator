# CLASIC CALCULATOR v1.0

## APP SUMMARY

This HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code represents a simple yet interactive calculator web application. The HTML structure defines the layout, including a display area, a simulated solar panel, and various buttons for numbers, operators, and special functions. The CSS applies styles to ensure a modern and visually appealing design, including custom fonts, a responsive layout, and 3D button effects. The JavaScript handles the calculator's functionality, including number input, arithmetic operations, and a countdown timer that powers off the display after a period of inactivity. Special features include converting numbers to words, playing audio effects, and rotating the calculator display when specific numbers are entered.

## LEARNING UPDATE

### Converting Numbers to Words

One of the key features of this project was converting numerical inputs into their spelled-out form on the display. This involved creating a JavaScript function that handles both integer and decimal numbers, and accounts for special cases and edge conditions. This task helped me improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of JavaScript string manipulation and number handling.

### Dynamic CSS Styling

Another interesting challenge was implementing dynamic CSS styling to flip the calculator display when the number 0.1134 is input, causing it to spell out "hello." This required integrating CSS transformations and JavaScript event handling to achieve the desired effect. This experience enhanced my knowledge of CSS animations and transformations, as well as how to trigger these styles through JavaScript based on specific conditions.
